## Analyses: error control

* Error control as every item gets ranked via [Benjamini & Yekutieli method](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1013699998). This method is conservative, as compared to other methods (e.g., Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).

--

* Makes no assumptions regarding the dependency of _p_ values. 

--

* An alternative is the Bonferroni method.

## Some descriptives: Guardian 2024.

* For 2024, Business and Management (code S240) has the most institutions ranked (_n_ = 119). 

--

* In contrast, Veterinary Science (code S030) had the fewest institutions ranked with just ten institutions being ranked. 

--

* In total, across all 66 subjects, 3,738 ranks were produced in 2024. 

--

* The Guardian institution list allows for ties in rankings (for 2024: 15 ties, none in top 20) as does the subject ranking list, but these are relatively rare at subject level (for 2024: _Median_ = 2.5 ties across 66 subjects).

## Results Guardian 2024

* Approximately half of the Russell Group universities were not included in the list.

--

* List also included some non-Russell Group members (e.g., St Andrews, Swansea).

--

* The correspondence between the two ranking lists was acceptable, both when including any institution ranked in the subject list (Spearman $\rho$ = .667) and when restricting to universities which are listed in the GUG institution list (Spearman $\rho$ = .673). 

--

* The absolute median rank shift between the two methods is 18 ranks (_n_ = 122 institutions ranked). 

--

* Some institutions did not move (min = 0), but at its extreme they can move with over 100 ranks (max = 103).

The correspondence between the 24 Russell Group universities’ rankings between the two methods is relatively poor (Spearman $\rho$ = .574).

---
## Results: Guardian 2023-2024 change descriptives.

* The correspondence between an institution's rank for 2023 and 2024 was strong (Spearman $\rho$ = .929). 

--

* Ten universities did not move ranks between 2023 and 2024 (`r round((10/121)*100,digits=2)`%). 

--

* The median movement on the institution list was five ranks -- significantly different from 0 (Wilcoxon signed rank test = 6216, _p_ < .00001). 

--

* The biggest climbers were Portsmouth and SOAS with each climbing 34 ranks, respectively from 67 to 33 and from 86 to 52. 

--

* Largest drop, 42 places: Keele University moving from rank 32 in 2023 to rank 74 in 2024.

## Results: Guardian 2023-2024 change descriptives II

* For 3,556 items ranked we were able to calculate a rank difference between 2023 and 2024. 

--

* There was strong correspondence between 2023 and 2024 ranks (Spearman $\rho$ = .863). 

--

* Median movement across all items in ranks was six ranks (min = 0, max = 66). 

--

* All subjects showed significant changes in ranks between 2023 and 2024 (all Wilcoxon signed rank tests of median movement against 0, _p_ < .05). 

--

* 245 out of 3,556 items did not move rank (`r round((245/3556)*100,digits=2)`%). 

--

* largest individual climber was the University of East London in Business and Management studies (S240) from rank 100 to 34.

--

* largest individual drop was by Keele university in Computer Science & Information Systems (S220) from rank 20 in 2023 to rank 85 in 2024. 

---
## Results: Guardian 2023-2024 change descriptives III

* Veterinary Sciences (S030) had the lowest median movement (Median = .5 rank) and Animation and Game design (S225) had the greatest median movement (Median = 11 ranks). 

--

* The greatest correspondence between 2023 and 2024 ranks was found in Medicine (S010, Spearman $\rho$ = .954, _n_ = 36), the poorest correspondence was for Anatomy (S040, Spearman $\rho$ = .505, _n_ = 21). 

--

* The vast majority of subject rankings were stable (Spearman $\rho$ $\geq$ .667, for 61 out of 66 subjects), with most showing strong stability (Spearman $\rho$ $\geq$ .8, for 41 out of 66 subjects).

---
## Results Guardian 2023-2024 vs. RRA method

*  Just three universities out of 121 ranked in total, i.e. Leeds, Birmingham, Hull, experienced a significant drop based on the RRA method.

--

* Conclusion is the same regardless of the choice for the Benjamini & Yekutieli adjustment (Benjamini & Yekutieli: _p_ < .00001, _p_ = .0030, _p_ = .0146) or Bonferroni adjustment (Bonferroni: _p_ < .00001, _p_ = .0011, _p_ = .0081).

--

*  No significant climbers based on the RRA method when applying an adjustment based  Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001), at _p_ = .05. 

--

* One significant climber, The University of Brighton, based on the RRA method following Bonferroni correction (_p_ = .045). The second ranked climber, the University of Portsmouth: no longer a significant climber after Bonferroni correction (_p_ = .069).

--

* Little correspondence: _Drops_: Spearman $\rho$ = .187. _Climbs_: Spearman $\rho$ = .259.

## Results: CUG 2024 descriptives

* There are 130 institutions ranked in the institution list for 2024, but 151 unique institutions appear in the list of 74 subjects.

* As with the Guardian University Guide 2024, Business and Management Studies has the most institutions ranked (_n_ = 121). The smallest list was for Celtic studies where only five institutions were ranked. 

--

* The Complete University Guide institution list allows for ties in rankings (for 2024: 14 ties; none in top 60). However, in their subject ranking list, only one subject showed ties (Drama, Dance, and Cinematics), and just one tie.

* No surprises perhaps: rankings do not correspond between methods...

* Example 24 Russell Group rankings correlate at .574 (GUG) and .394 (CUG)

---
## Limitations

* Largely descriptive... .

--

* More than one way to solve this problem... . (Some use ordinal distance)

--

* Specialists might do less well under 'RRA'. 

--

* Weighing of subjects? --> opens door further for bias?
